		<h1>About this <strong>site</strong></h1>	
		<p>Besides a resume and contact showcase this site is like a sandbox where I can apply new tricks learnt in web development.

			<h1>For those interested in "under the hood" stuff (back-end):</h1>
			<p>This site was built with <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/" title="nanoc">nanoc</a>, an awesome Ruby framework created by Denis Defreyne.<br/><a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/" title="nanoc">nanoc</a> is a tool that runs on your local computer and compiles documents written in formats such as <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a>, Textile, <a href="http://haml.info/" title="Haml">Haml</a>… into a static web site consisting of simple HTML files.</p>

			<h1>For those interested in user experience and design (front-end):</h1>
			<p>This site uses HTML5 semantics also some CSS3 new properties like transformations, @face fonts, media queries, shadows, etc.</p>
			<p>This site was built applying responsive and adaptative web design thanks to the new media query CSS3 property. This site can adaptate to any smartphone, tablet or mobile device using only one cascade style sheet without specific development for those devices. In fact you can play with it resizing your navigation window.</p>
